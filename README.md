  Metalsmith bare-bones starter
</h1>

> **This starter is deprecated. Use the [Metalsmith2025 Simple Starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith2025-simple-starter) instead!**

Start off your Metalsmith journey with this bare-bones boilerplate. This starter includes Markdown content and Nunjucks templating. Check out a [demo of this starter](https://metalsmith-bare-bones-starter.netlify.app/).

## Quick start

1.  **Create a Metalsmith site.**

    Clone the starter repository to create a new site.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-bare-bones-starter.git new-site
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd new-site/
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

    Open the `new-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/index.md`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1.  To tidy up your code with ESlint and Prettier, run: `npm run lint` and `npm run format`.
