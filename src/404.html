# SPECIAL 404 ERROR PAGE
# This page is shown when someone visits a URL that doesn't exist
# The filename "404.html" is a web server convention for error pages

title: Page not found  # Simple title (no SEO object needed for error pages)
layout: simple.njk     # Use the same layout as other pages
permalink: false       # IMPORTANT: This prevents Metalsmith from changing the filename
                      # We want this to stay as "404.html" not "404/index.html"
